# COMP10001

This is the respository for all of my answers for the University of Melbourne's [COMP10001 Foundations of Computing](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp10001) class' worksheets. Originally posted on [GrokLearning](https://groklearning.com/). As well as any notes that I may have decided to publish.

## NOTICE
It is important to remember that the answers are mine, and mine alone. IT IS NOT:

* A solution from any lecturer, tutor, or teaching staff at the University of Melbourne or other educational institutions.
* A solution with guaranteed of obtaining full marks or correction answers.
* A template for you to model your solutions on any assessments on. These are my solutions.
* A reason to believe that the work in relevant. The curiculum of COMP10001 changes every semester. The worksheets are not the same. While they may have the same name and the title, the questions asked are lightly altered that can fundamentally change the code needed to be written. Hence the code within this repository is useless.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
* All files in the solutions follows [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (Python Enhancement Proposals 8). 
* All file-level `docstring` repeats the questions in the GrokLearning worksheet. Often these worksheets provide mathematical equations written in LaTeX which have not been repeated in the LaTeX language.
